# Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn
here you can learn the basics of the scikit-learn using machine learning , 
In this repo i have made a simple scikit algo which can help you to train your model. 
Here you can understand about Linear Regression, Classification and boosting optimization that are simply classified

# Algorithms we'll go over (in order):
